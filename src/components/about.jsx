              <p>Here is where the text would be and for the sake of my own sanity, I have just entered random text. You will see this text all throughout this project. I has officially lost my mind, I believe, so don't mind me. I really just needed a filler so this doesn't look like the absolute worst. Is It bad that I really am trying but the absolute beast of a project I've given myself has led me to putting random text in here? I probably should have chosen a topic that made more sense like a fake store or something. Anyways, this is the end of this. Thanks for reading. </p>
